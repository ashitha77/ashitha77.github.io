	<h1>Life Under The Sea</h1>
	<div class = "container">
	<p>With so much of the Earth’s surface taken up by ocean, it’s evident how vital these marine environments are to the planet, and how much there still is to be explored. As so much of the Earth’s surface is underwater, it comes as no surprise that marine species outnumber those on land. But, it’s an incredible 94 per cent of the Earth’s living species that exist within the oceans. According to the Ocean Service, man has explored less than five per cent of Earth’s oceans. As researchers strive to discover more, we’re continually getting to know our oceans better. We still only know a fraction of the marine species in our oceans. It’s possible to find rivers and lakes beneath the ocean. Below are some of the cool sea animal pics !!</p>
